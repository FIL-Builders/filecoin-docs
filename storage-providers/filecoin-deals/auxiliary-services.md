  As a storage provider, you can set your business apart from the rest by
  offering additional services to your customers. Many new use-cases for the
  Filecoin network are emerging as new technologies are

# Auxiliary services

## FVM

Other new opportunities are emerging since the launch of FVM (Filecoin Virtual Machine) in March 2023. The FVM allows smart contracts to be executed on the Filecoin blockchain. The FVM is Ethereum-compatible (also called the FEVM) and allows for entire new use cases to be developed in the Filecoin ecosystem. Think of on-chain FIL lending as an example, but the opportunities are countless.

## Bacalhau

A next step after the introduction of FVM is [Bacalhau](https://docs.bacalhau.org/)), which will be offering Compute over Data (COD). After the introduction of a compute layer on Filecoin, Bacalhau’s COD promises to run compute jobs over the data where the data resides, at the storage provider. Today, data scientists have to transfer their datasets to compute farms in order for their AI, ML or other data processing activities to run. Bacalhau will allow them to run compute activities on the data where the data is located, thereby removing the expensive requirement to move data around. Storage providers will be able to offer - and get rewarded for - providing compute power to data scientists and other parties who want to execute COD.

## Storage tiering

Another potential service to offer is storage tiers with various performance profiles. For example, storage providers can offer hot/online storage by keeping an additional copy of the unsealed data available for immediate retrieval, as well as the sealed that has been stored on the Filecoin Network.
