  As a storage provider, you can set your business apart from the rest by
  offering additional services to your customers. This page highlights a few
  optional service areas to consider as the Filecoin ecosystem evolves.

# Auxiliary services

## FVM

Other new opportunities are emerging since the launch of FVM (Filecoin Virtual Machine) in March 2023. The FVM allows smart contracts to be executed on the Filecoin blockchain. The FVM is Ethereum-compatible (also called the FEVM) and allows for entire new use cases to be developed in the Filecoin ecosystem. Think of on-chain FIL lending as an example, but the opportunities are countless.

## Storage tiering

Another potential service to offer is storage tiers with various performance profiles. For example, storage providers can offer hot/online storage by keeping an additional copy of the unsealed data available for immediate retrieval, as well as the sealed that has been stored on the Filecoin Network.
