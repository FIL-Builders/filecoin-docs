# FOC documentation index

{% hint style="info" %}
FOC guidance is still consolidating.

Use this page as a stable placeholder index until full FOC documentation is published.
{% endhint %}

For current guidance:

* Start from [Modern storage patterns](modern-storage-patterns.md).
* Use [PDP documentation](../../storage-providers/pdp/README.md) for current in-repo modern storage workflows.

This page will be expanded as additional FOC documentation becomes available.
